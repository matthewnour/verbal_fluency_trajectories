% tbl = simple_mixed_anova(datamat, between_factors, within_factor_names,

%
% Repeated-measures or mixed ANOVA with any number of factors. 
%
% Function built on top of existing MATLAB functions in an attempt to
% simplify user inputs and manipulations while still being able to perform
% all common ANOVA designs.
%
% DATAMAT is a numerical matrix containing the values associated with each 
% level of each within-subject factor in each subject (responses). The 
% subjects should always be the first dimension of the matrix. Each 
% within-subject factor is another dimension.
%
% BETWEEN_FACTORS is a numerical matrix where each row represents a subject 
% and each column represents a between-subjects factor. A given value
% represents the level of the column's factor associated with the row's 
% subject. Optional.
%
% WITHIN_FACTOR_NAMES is a cell array of strings indicating the name of
% each within-subject factor (one for each dimension of the datamat
% variable except the first, in order). Optional.
%
% BETWEEN_FACTOR_NAMES is a cell array of strings indicating the name of
% each between-subjects factor (one for each column of the between_factors
% matrix, in order). These factors are assumed to be categorical (groups). 
% Optional.
%
% TABLE is a table indicating the F statistics, p-values and other
% statistics associated with each term of the model. The "intercept" terms
% can be ignored (e.g. "(Intercept):WS01" indicates the main effect of 
% WS01).
%
% RM is a structure with the repeated measures model parameters and
% statistics.
%
% Does not support covariates or partial models (without all interactions)
% for now.
%
%
% EXAMPLE
%
% A design with 24 subjects and 2 within-subject factors, the first one 
% having 3 levels (time: pre-test, 1st post-test, 2nd post-test) and the 
% second one 4 levels (experimental condition: A, B, C, D). The subjects 
% are grouped in 4 groups: 2 variables with 2 levels each (gender: male or
% female; age group: young or old).
%
% The input datamat should be a 24 x 3 x 4 matrix with each row
% corresponding to a subject. So the element datamat(1,1,1) will correspond
% to the response of the subject #1 in the pre-test in experimental
% condition A, the element datamat(2,3,2) will correspond to the response
% of the subject #2 in the 2nd post-test in experimental condition B, and
% so on.
%
% The input between_factors will be a 24 x 2 matrix with each row
% corresponding to a subject and each column to a between-subjects factor
% (gender and age). Each column will be filled with 1s and 2s, or
% 0s and 1s, or other numbers, indicating the gender/age group of the 
% respective subject.
%
% tbl = simple_mixed_anova(datamat, between_factors, {'Time', 'Exp_cond'},
% {'Gender', 'Age_group'})
